        <p>
          I started my crypto journey as a full-time trader before transitioning
          into community management. Before that, I spent about a year as a
          bounty hunter, writing articles for various crypto communities. That
          experience introduced me to the power of community engagement, and
          since then, Iâ€™ve been deeply invested in building and managing
          thriving communities. Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked across different
          sectorsâ€”including business, finance, branding, fitness, and even
          musicâ€”but my passion remains in crypto communities. I develop
          strategies, build strong teams, and ensure projects have the right
          community support to thrive. As a personal brand, I strive to be the
          mentor I never had when I first entered the space. I actively share
          knowledge and resources to equip emerging community leaders across the
          crypto ecosystem. ðŸ”— Want to Work with Me? Check out my Portfolio to
