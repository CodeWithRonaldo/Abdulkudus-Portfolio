          <p>
            I work primarily with goal-driven cryptocurrency projects to engage
            and grow their communities. <br />
            <br />
            All procedures begin with a strategy, and depending on your needs, I
            can either: <br />
            <br />
            - Just draw up a strategy for you; <br />
            - Draw up a strategy & manage the community <br />
            - Just manage the community using your strategy <br />- Provide team
            members (Discord developer, moderators, social media managers) to
            handle your project <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            I have been in the Community Management space for 5 years, working
            across industries like digital marketing, branding, business,
            finance, and food. <br />
            <br />
            Over the past year, I have specialized in the crypto space,
            transitioning from a Community Moderator to a full-fledged Community
            Manager. <br />
            <br /> As a Community Manager, my role involves bridging the gap
            between your team and the community—gathering valuable feedback,
            engaging members, and implementing growth strategies. <br />
            <br /> Essentially, I’m the one who wakes up in the morning with
            your community in mind.

            <h1>COMMUNITY STRATEGY</h1>

            <p>
              This package is ideal for projects that already have a community
              team but need structured strategies to enhance engagement. <br />
              <br /> It's also perfect for projects yet to launch and are not
              ready to hire a full team. <br />
              <br />
              <b>How it works</b> <br />
              <br /> - I review your project details and goals. <br /> - You
              share your expectations for the community. <br />- I develop a
              tailored community strategy. <br /> - First draft is sent for
              review. <br /> - Final strategy is delivered after two revisions.{" "}
