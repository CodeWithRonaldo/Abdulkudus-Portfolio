          <p>
          I started my crypto journey as a full-time trader before transitioning
          into community management. <br /> Before that, I spent about a year as a
          bounty hunter, writing articles for various crypto communities. <br /> That
          experience introduced me to the power of community engagement, and
          since then, <br />Iâ€™ve been deeply invested in building and managing
          thriving communities.
